# Non-Local Means (NLM) Filter

## Explanation
The Non-Local Means (NLM) filter is an advanced denoising algorithm used in image processing. Unlike traditional filters that average pixel values within a local neighborhood, the NLM filter averages pixel values based on the similarity of small patches across the entire image. This approach helps preserve textures and details while effectively reducing noise.

## How It Works

1. **Patch Comparison**:
   - For each pixel, a small patch centered on the pixel is compared to patches centered on other pixels in the image.
   - The similarity between patches is calculated using a weighted Euclidean distance.

2. **Weight Calculation**:
   - Weights are assigned based on the similarity of patches. More similar patches receive higher weights.
   - The weight for a pixel \( j \) with respect to pixel \( i \) is given by:
     $$
     w(i, j) = \exp\left(-\frac{\|P_i - P_j\|^2}{h^2}\right)
     $$
     where \( P_i \) and \( P_j \) are the patches centered at pixels \( i \) and \( j \), and \( h \) is a filtering parameter.

3. **Averaging**:
   - The value of the pixel is replaced by the weighted average of all pixels in the image:
     $$
     I_{\text{denoised}}(i) = \frac{\sum_j w(i, j) I(j)}{\sum_j w(i, j)}
     $$

## Pros and Cons
- **Pros**:
  - Excellent at preserving textures and details.
  - Effective at reducing noise.
- **Cons**:
  - Very computationally intensive.
  - Requires careful tuning of parameters.

## When to Use
- Use when you need to reduce noise while preserving fine details and textures in the image.

## Sample Code Implementation

Here's a simple implementation in Python using OpenCV:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
from skimage import img_as_float
from skimage.restoration import denoise_nl_means, estimate_sigma
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

# Load the image
img = cv2.imread('image.jpg', 0)
img = img_as_float(img)

# Estimate the noise standard deviation from the noisy image
sigma_est = np.mean(estimate_sigma(img, multichannel=False))

# Apply Non-Local Means (NLM) filter
patch_kw = dict(patch_size=5, patch_distance=6, multichannel=False)
denoised_img = denoise_nl_means(img, h=1.15 * sigma_est, fast_mode=True, **patch_kw)

# Display the results
plt.subplot(121), plt.imshow(img, cmap='gray'), plt.title('Original Image')
plt.subplot(122), plt.imshow(denoised_img, cmap='gray'), plt.title('Non-Local Means Denoising')
plt.show()
